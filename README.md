# Rockfall-Prediction-and-Alert-System-for-Open-Pit-Mines
PitMine Flare is an AI-powered system to predict and prevent rockfall incidents in open-pit mines. Integrating geotechnical sensors, drone imagery, DEMs, and environmental data, it offers real-time risk maps, forecasts, and alerts. This open-source PoC uses LSTM models on synthetic data, with LiDAR/DEM integration in progress.
